# Medium Payroll Bypass Extension

## Description

The Medium Payroll Bypass Extension is a browser tool designed to help users access Medium articles that are behind a paywall. It achieves this by redirecting the article from its original Medium URL (or custom domain Medium URL) to an alternative service, `freedium.cfd`, which provides access to the content.

This extension aims to provide a smoother reading experience for users who frequently encounter Medium's metered paywall.

## Features

-   **Manual Bypass:** Users can manually trigger a bypass for the current Medium article via the extension's popup. The "Bypass Current Page" button is only enabled if the extension detects the current page as a Medium article.
-   **Context Menu Integration:** Right-clicking on any page provides a "Bypass Medium" option. If the current page is detected as a Medium article, selecting this option will redirect it to freedium.cfd.
-   **Smart Medium Detection:** The extension employs pattern matching to detect various Medium articles, including:
    -   Regular medium.com articles
    -   Custom subdomain Medium articles
    -   Medium-hosted publication articles
-   **User-Friendly Interface:**
    -   Clean, intuitive popup design
    -   Clear visual indication of current page status
    -   One-click bypass functionality
    -   Easy access through browser toolbar or context menu
